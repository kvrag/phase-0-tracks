# Pseudocode and write a method that takes a spy's real name (e.g., "Felicia Torres") and creates a fake name with it by doing the following:

# 1. Swapping the first and last name.
# 2. Changing all of the vowels to the next vowel in 'aeiou', and all of the consonants to the next consonant in the alphabet.

# IF you get really and truly stuck, just write an alias method that loops through the original name and changes the letters somehow.

# Success: "Felicia Torres" => "Vussit Gimodoe" 


# PSEUDOCODE
# Convert this assignment into an algorithm. (User interface comes later.)

#1. Swap the first and last name
# => Use .split(' ') to divide full name string into array of first and last
# => Use .reverse to swap the two names
# => Use .join(' ') to put the two names back into a single string

#2. For each name (first, last), change all vowels to the next vowel in 'aeiou'
# => Use .chars to divide name into array of characters
# => Use .map! do method to iterate through characters
# => If a vowel, use .gsub to define pattern /[aeiou]/ and .next to change vowels 

#3. For each name (first, last), change all consonants to next consonant 
# => If a consonant, use .gsub to define pattern /[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]/ and .next to change consonants 
# => Close .map! do method
# => Use .join('') to put chars back together into a string for each name


#1

full_name = "Felicia Torres"
reverse_name = full_name.split(' ').reverse!.join(' ')
# Full name is now reversed and is a two-word string

reverse_name.downcase! 
# Reversed name is now downcased for encrypting. 

#2

alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
letters = alpha.split('')

vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
consonants = letters - vowels 



code_name = reverse_name.chars.map! do |letter|
  if vowels.include? letter
    vowels[vowels.index(letter) + 1]
  elsif 
    consonants.include? letter 
    consonants[consonants.index(letter) + 1] 
  else
    letter 
  end
end

code_name.join(' ').capitalize!
