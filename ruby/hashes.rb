=begin
  
Pseudocode and write a program that will allow an interior designer to enter the details of a given client: the client's name, age, number of children, decor theme, and so on (you can choose your own as long as it's a good mix of string, integer, and boolean data).

Your keys should be symbols unless you find that you need a string for some reason.

PSEUDOCODE

- create hash with desired keys (values empty)
- collect values from user one key at a time
- convert each value to its appropriate data type
- store each value in its appropriate key
- print the hash back to the user
- ask user if changes need to be made (key, value) - not a loop
- update hash with changes
- print the hash back to the user and exit
