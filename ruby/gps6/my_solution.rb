# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Requiring an outside file relative to the current file - don't need file extension for fellow Ruby files
# Require calls a built-in module or can be used to require a file in any directory

require_relative 'state_data'
