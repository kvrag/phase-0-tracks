#  - Input: word as a string
#  - Divide input string into separate characters and store in correct-answers array
#  - Store underscores, the same number as correct-answer letters, to progress array

#     - the allowed number of guesses is 5

#     - the allowed number of guesses is 6

#           - insert input into progress array at these indexes, deleting the underscores that were in their place
#           - correct is true
#           - the number of guesses goes up by one
#           - return changed progress array
#       - IF the input is a repeat (appears in the array of guesses): 
#           - correct is true
#           - the number of guesses stays the same
#           - return unchanged progress array

#           - correct is false
#           - the number of guesses goes up by one
#           - return unchanged progress array
#  - WHEN the number of guesses is greater than the allowed number:
#     - Prompt a full-word guess
#     - YIELD to full-word guess method
#  - Output: boolean - correct/not correct

#  - Input: a string of more than one letter
#  - Establish that win is not true
#  - Divide input string into an array of letters
