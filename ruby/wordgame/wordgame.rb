# WORD GAME PSEUDOCODE 

# Initialize the game
#  - Create empty correct-answer array
#  - Create empty progress array
#  - Number of guesses is zero

# Store the correct answer
#  - Input: word as a string
#  - Divide input string into separate characters and store in correct-answers array
#  - Store underscores, the same number as correct-answer letters, to progress array
#  - Output: array - progress (underscores)
