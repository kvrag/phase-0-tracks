# JQuery

## 10 min: Make a Plan

1. Skim the JQuery chapter in Duckett, to get a general feel for what JQuery is used for and why (30 min).
2. Consult w3schools.com/jquery for quick guidelines on syntax, as well as list of common selectors (30 min).
3. Take a break (10 min).
4. Find a good cheat sheet (10-15 min).
5. Download JQuery and try a few examples, in Codecademy or elsewhere - look things up if they don't make sense (remainder).

## 2 hrs: Study Up

- Skimming Duckett helped me know what to look for and expect.
- Practicing examples in w3schools and Codecademy helped me wrap my head around the basic concepts.
- The cheat sheet will serve me well in Release 2.
