<!-- Release 4: Reflect -->

<!-- Purpose of HTML5 Semantic Tags: To create meaningful sections within the document, to make styling easier (especially mobile-friendly styling), to make it easier for accessibility programs to parse the content. I think nav is super useful, as well as header and footer - the more specific, the better. Main and section are a little murkier. -->

<!-- Order the Browser Uses to Display Elements on a Page: The browser uses the heading tags (1, 2, 3) to assign relative rank/ importance to different sections; besides that, the way the elements are nested has a big influence on the order of the page. Generally elements appear as they are written in the html from top to bottom, unless styled otherwise with CSS. -->

<!-- What I Learned About Sublime: I learned that Sublime can offer a much richer coding environment than a regular text editor, if the user takes the time to create snippets and customize the program. I'm sure snippets will help a lot as my coding gets more sophisticated and complex, so I'm sure to create more in the future. -->

<!-- What Concept Was Most Difficult: Scope was definitely the concept that was most difficult to wrap my head around during the challenge, but once I understood what it meant - essentially telling Sublime that this particular snippet only applies to a particular type of document - it became much clearer. -->
