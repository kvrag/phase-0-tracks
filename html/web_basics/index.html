<h1>The Panther in My Living Room</h1>
<p>Three years ago, I wandered into an animal shelter and met almost every cat they had. I almost went home, and then a big ol' black ex-tomcat meandered my way, sat in front of me, and stared at me affably with huge green eyes. So, yeah, I was <em>toast</em>.</p>
<p>I realized a few things when I brought my new buddy <strong>Dexter</strong> home.</p>
<h3>Things I Realized</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dexter is a BIG OL' CAT. Carrying him home from the shelter four blocks away from my apartment was not a good idea.</li>
<li>Dexter has an adorable boxy face that gives him a certain... something...</li>
<li>This is the something. DEXTER IS A <a href="https://pixabay.com/p-699251/?no_redirect">MINI PANTHER</a>.</li></ol>
<h3>More Evidence</h3>
<ul><li>Dexter eats as if he doesn't know where his next meal is coming from.</li>
<li>He does not enjoy being picked up and carried, nor, I imagine, would a panther.</li>
<li>He enjoys lounging in the shadows under beds and chairs, as his black coat dictates that this is where he is least likely to be disturbed vis a vis camouflage, just like panthers hide in undergrowth.</li>
</ul>
